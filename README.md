# Wids21-solution
This repository is my solution for the Women in Data Science competition(2021) on Kaggle. Given datasets on patient's records, participants had to build a model to predict whether each patient got diabetes or not. In  the notebook,  I processed data and utilized a Tree-based model and some ML techniques to finally achieve AUC score of 0.86x.
